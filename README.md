Hacking windows vm using metasploit module in kali vm
**Hands-on 1: Hacking into Metasploitable 2**

Participants initiate their journey by hacking into the Metasploitable 2 environment, a deliberately vulnerable machine. This exercise aims to provide a practical understanding of penetration testing using tools such as Metasploit. Through the exploration of vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, participants gain insights into the methodologies of ethical hacking.

**Hands-on 2: Hacking into Windows VM**

This exercise involves interacting with a Windows VM, employing tools like Armitage in Kali VM. Participants scan the Windows VM, identify potential vulnerabilities, and deploy specific exploits. The objective is to simulate the process of identifying and exploiting weaknesses in a Windows environment, enhancing the participants' ability to conduct ethical hacking in varied scenarios.

**Hands-on 3: Capturing Screenshot**

The focus of this exercise is on post-exploitation activities. Participants, acting as attackers, utilize Meterpreter to infiltrate the target and capture a screenshot of the compromised Windows VM. This exercise provides a practical illustration of how attackers can gather visual information from a compromised system.

**Hands-on 4: Keystroke Logging**

Building on the previous exercise, participants continue their exploration of post-exploitation techniques by employing keystroke logging. The use of Meterpreter commands—keyscan_start, keyscan_dump, and keyscan_stop—allows participants to understand the process of capturing and extracting keystrokes from a compromised system.

**Hands-on 5: Deploying Persistent Backdoor**

The final exercise involves deploying a persistent backdoor in the Windows startup folder. Participants learn how to maintain access to a compromised system even after a restart. This exercise highlights the significance of securing startup folders and mitigating the risk of persistent threats.
